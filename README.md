## Synopsis

This project will provide an API that returns responses as JSON but stores the data as a sufficiently nested YAML file in git.  This API will provide CRUD operations and a rewind feature that will provide the user the ability to view changes back in time.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project stems from a desire to reduce even further the cost of storing data while also further reducing ones dependance on services such as AWS and Azure.
